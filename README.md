Hi, I am `jjack`, primarily a PHP developer by circumstance.

Since my profile is quite boring, I'll share the tale of how I hated PHP and how I came to like the language.
*It all started a long time ago...* whilst I was still in college studying Software Development I was told
"You have to code in PHP." which my first impression of the language was "Ew, what is this?" with some fighting back
and forth over choice of language and the subject matter I eventually gave in and looked for a quick solution which came to be
Laravel.
Coming into University, my distaste for PHP had not left and I soon found myself in a predicament where I needed to use "plain" PHP
in order to get a few tasks done for a module. I ended up failing that module and whilst I currently write this, I am doing the resit for
that module.
But despite my failures, I found a good connection with a local company and by showing my fundamental knowledge of Web Development I was able
to secure an entry level spot at a local company.

The lesson I tend to share with developers is that you should never let your ego get in the way of your development.
Embrace 'dated' and 'crappy' tools and languages. Explore and learn.
Or don't. This is just my boring README file.
